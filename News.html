    <h3>Dominant Barcelona beat Espanyol to win 27th LaLiga title</h3>
    <br>

    <p>Barcelona claimed their 27th LaLiga title and first for four years on <br>
        Sunday after two first-half goals from Robert Lewandowski spurred <br>
        them to a comfortable 4-2 victory over city rivals Espanyol. <br>
        Barca moved to 85 points from 34 matches and extended their lead to an
        unassailable 14 points over second-placed Real Madrid.
        There was little time for jubilation, however, as the visitors had to quickly
        rush off the pitch after fulltime as several Espanyol fans invaded the field as 
        Barca started to celebrate their title."I think it was enough. It's normal to celebrate
        but I understand we aren't at home and you can't be disrespectful," Baca coach Xavi Hernandez 
        said after the match. "I know it is difficult to control sometimes, but I told the players it
        was better to head in."Espanyol coach Luis Garcia took a different view of the home supporter's reactions,
        which led to a confrontation involving Barca players in the tunnel that forced police to intervene.
        Barcelona have won 27 of their 34 games this season, with their title charge 
        built largely on their outstanding defence, which has conceded a measly 13 goals,
        by far the best defensive record in Europe's top five leagues.

    <h3>Asia Cup entry marks red-letter day for Nepali cricket</h3>

        <p>The light rain following Nepal's seven-wicket victory over the United Arab Emirates in the final match of the ACC Premier Cup on Tuesday
            seemed to be no less than a silent acknowledgement of a great team by the cricketing gods.
            The victory secured for Nepal a rare berth in the Asia Cup later this year.
            In the final match that stretched over two days due to on-and-off rain, Nepal bowled out the visitors for 117 runs in 33.3 overs,
            as Lalit Rajbanshi dismissed Junaid Siddiqu on 10 runs after the UAE resumed their innings on Tuesday at 106-9.
            Chasing the target, Nepal made 118-3 in 30.3 overs on the back of an unbeaten half century by Gulsan Jha (67 runs)
            who shared an unbroken 96-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Bhim Sharki (36 runs).
            The victory ensured Nepal, the only unbeaten side in the 10-team tournament, a place alongside global cricket giants India and Pakistan in the group stage of the Asia Cup,
            should the tournament scheduled for September go ahead as planned. The other group consists of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.
            It is the second time Nepal has qualified for the Asia Cup after 2002, when they finished runners up in the ACC Trophy.
            But the tournament did not take place due to the India-Pakistan conflict. Some media reports suggest India is reluctant to take part in the tournament,
            putting the future of the event in doubt.</p>

    <h3>Lowe: Can LeBron and the Los Angeles Lakers take down Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets?</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="basketball">
        <img src="./Basketball.jfif" alt="lebron and jokic">
        <p>So much has changed since the Los Angeles Lakers and Denver Nuggets clashed in this round three seasons ago in the Orlando bubble -- and yes,
            the reappearance of all four bubble semifinalists lends their 2020 runs some credibility ballast they never needed anyway.
            The bubble was different, but that never made what anyone achieved (or failed to achieve) there any less meaningful.
            It was the only option. There was a four-month break, no fans, a friendlier shooting background and no travel. 
            Every contender dealt with the same conditions. Some quaked. Some rose up.
            The Lakers then, as now, were win-now contenders. The Nuggets were newbies, usurpers, uninvited crashers of the presumed Battle for Los Angeles conference finals between the Lakers and the LA Clippers.
            Only Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic, Michael Porter Jr. and Vlatko Cancar remain from that 2020 Denver team. LeBron James and Anthony Davis are the only Lakers holdovers. Injuries have dotted their head-to-head games since.
            All four of their matchups this season came before the Lakers traded Russell Westbrook.
            In those conference finals, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope guarded Murray; now he starts alongside Murray.

    <h3>India ready for first assignment under new coach Craig Fulton</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="hockey">
        <img src="./Hockey.avif" alt="Coach of india">
        <p>A couple of weeks into his new job, Craig Fulton has already made his intentions clear with the changes he has brought to the Indian men's hockey squad
        that will be heading to Europe for the Pro League later this month.
        In his first assignment as India chief coach, Fulton has brought back Simranjeet Singh into the 24-member squad.
        India's Olympic hero, who scored a brace in the bronze medal match against Germany in Tokyo,
        has been out of the team for the last two years.While earlier it was a knee injury that put him out of action after the Tokyo Olympics,
        he returned to play at the Asia Cup last year but was ruled out due to a hamstring injury. 
        In the last two years, the forward has played only one match in the blue India jersey, against Pakistan in the Asia Cup in Jakarta.
        Another Olympic bronze medallist, Sumit has also made the team after missing out on the World Cup in Odisha in January.
        I am pleased with the team we have selected for the upcoming Pro League tournament against Belgium, Holland, Great Britain and Argentina. 
        Our current world ranking of fourth reflects the team's hard work and dedication post the World Cup," said Fulton, who is South African. 
        â€œThis tournament will be a great opportunity for us to compete against top-ranked teams and further improve our overall game.
